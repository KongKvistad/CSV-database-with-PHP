the text files are designed as follows:

students:
    studnr, name, surname, birthday.

    * the user may overwrite / append to these data, as well as append to stud_course, but nothing else.
    there are no problems with overwriting students.csv and adding a new line to stud_course at the same time,
    because the latter only shares the "studnr" key with students.csv.


courses:
    code, semester, name, year, credits, 

    * i'm assuming that the input file cannot write new fields to stud_course unnless
    All the fields relevant to the course don't match/exist.


instructor: 
 inst_id, name.


stud_course:
    studnr, c.code, grade and c.semester
    * this is a relational file, coupling a taken course with the respective student


inst_course:
    inst_id, c.code, 
    * this is a relational file, coupling a given class with the respective instructor.
    i'm assuming that the input file should not be able to write to stud_course unless
    the relevant fields exist in this one.
